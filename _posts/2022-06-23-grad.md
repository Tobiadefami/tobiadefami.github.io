# grad

JAX provides an API -jax.grad- for taking the gradients of functions in a similar way defined by vector calculus. Given a function $f(x)$, $\nabla f$ represents the function that computes $f$'s gradient, i.e. 

$$(\nabla{f})(x_i) = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i} (x).$$

It is a popular transformation used to compute the gradient of a given function -- it takes a numerical function written in python and returns a new python function which computes the gradient of the original function.

Using jax.grad(f) in a similar manner as shown in the equation above provides a function that computes the gradient of a given function, hence jax.grad(f)(x) computes the gradient of the function $f$ at point $x$



Example; let us define a function that takes an array and returns a sum of squares

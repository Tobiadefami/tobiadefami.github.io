Hey, now that you're here I guess I should introduce myself -- My name is Oluwatobi Adefami and i'm a machine learning researcher that specializes in document layout analysis, document understanding and the general document AI domain. I am particularly interested in taking a machine learning approach toward problem solving and I am fanatical about learning new methods and tricks that arise in the machine learning space. You can follow me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/_tobie__) for paper reviews.
